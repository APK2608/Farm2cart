```
FruitShop Flutter Project

How to run:
1. Create a new Flutter project or replace the `lib/` folder with the provided `lib/main.dart`.
2. Create a folder `assets/images/` and add your artwork images (thumbnail placeholders). The UI will fallback to bundled placeholder icons if you don’t add images.
3. Run `flutter pub get`.
4. Run `flutter run` (or launch from your IDE).

Files included in this canvas:
- pubspec.yaml
- lib/main.dart
- assets/images/ (place your images here)

Notes:
- This project uses Provider for simple state (wishlist + cart).
- The UI demonstrates: splash/logo, home with grid and top carousel, product category pages, wishlist, cart page with quantities, account page. It's intentionally simple but fully functional.
